# Team Generator
  Created by Chris Cavazos
  
  # Description
  
  This project is all about teams. With this application, a user can run the inquirer prompts on their local CLI to add employees to their team, then an HTML page will be generated with a card for every team member!

  Each employee is generated through questions using the inquirer package in npm. Each employee can be given a role as Manager, Engineer or an Intern. Using classes, each employee is stored as an object.
